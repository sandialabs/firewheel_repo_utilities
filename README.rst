This repository contains FIREWHEEL Model Components that are generally useful to many FIREWHEEL experiments, but do not belong in `firewheel_repo_base <https://github.com/sandialabs/firewheel_repo_base>`_ because they are not required for *all* experiments.
Currently, there are MCs related to extracting analytics from VMs, installing/configuring Python within a VM, adding tcpdump, adding Wireshark, adding Docker, and installing build tools.
