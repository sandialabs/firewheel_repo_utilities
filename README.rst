Utilities

This repository contains FIREWHEEL Model Components that are generally useful to many FIREWHEEL experiments, but do not belong in :ref:`base_mc_repo` because they are not required for *all* experiments.
Currently, there are MCs related to extracting analytics from VMs, installing/configuring Python within a VM, adding tcpdump, adding Wireshark, adding Docker, and installing build tools.
